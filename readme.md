# Widget that will mark, on a calendar, if you met your calorie goal 

## Purpose 
I want to lose weight. Now, I saw the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks, and there was one scene in which he drops 40 pounds (of course, this scene was supposedly over the course of '4 years', but in reality, was probably over the course of 4 months). 
 
I was a bit frustrated with my progress, and so asked ChatGPT how many calories I would need to eat in order to lose weight. Here was its answer: 

'If you want to lose 1.5 pounds per week, you would need to create a weekly calorie deficit of 5250 calories (3500 calories x 1.5). This is roughly a daily calorie deficit of 750 calories (5250 calories / 7 days).

Given your updated total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) of 1800 calories (1400 calories from BMR + 400 calories from physical activity), you would need to consume 1050 calories a day (1800 calories - 750 calories) to create a daily calorie deficit of 750 calories.

While this is a higher daily calorie intake than the previous calculations, it's still lower than what most health professionals recommend as a daily minimum. Consuming fewer than 1200-1500 calories per day for women and 1500-1800 calories per day for men can lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health problems.

To safely and sustainably lose weight, consider aiming for a smaller calorie deficit that allows for a higher daily calorie intake. Increasing your physical activity can also help create a larger calorie deficit without having to restrict your calorie intake as much.

Remember to consult with a healthcare provider before beginning any new diet or weight loss plan. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.'
